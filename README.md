## Catalog App Overview
I will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

The main python packages include `flask`, `sqlalchemy`, `oauth2client`, `httplib2`. 
The database can be initialized by 
```buildoutcfg
python initialize.py
```
To start the webapp, simply run
```buildoutcfg
python application.py
```
in the terminal.
